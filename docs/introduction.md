# Introduction

**Wicara** (previously kata-kit) is the React implementation of the Kata Design System (KDS). Developing apps according to KDS is now easy thanks to this library of modular, reusable components.

**Note: Wicara is still in beta.**

## Principles

These principles guide us on what to strive for when building components for Wicara.

### Clear and transparent.

- Use component/prop names that are as clear and standard as possible.
- Strive for component + prop names no longer than 2-3 words.
- Use the onVerb naming structure for event handlers.
- Keep component/prop names concise without being clever.
- When in doubt, look at other component libraries for inspiration.

### Modular and reusable.

- Components should do one thing and do it well.
- Strive for a modular component architecture. Prefer importing existing components with similar uses rather than reinventing the wheel.
- Consider leveraging React features + patterns like render/children props for enhanced modularity + easy reuse of components.
- Strive for a cleaner API. Don’t expose underlying internals in the API unless necessary.
- Use the theming API to ensure components can be restyled outside of the library itself.

### Accessibility comes first.

- Components should be designed with accessibility in mind. Make sure the fancy features doesn’t break accessibility. (Morten Rand-Hendriksen)
- Strive for an accessible color contrast ratio. Aim for a contrast rating higher than “AA” and “AA Large”. (Check your color contrast [here](https://colorable.jxnblk.com/))
- Make sure components work well with screen readers, as well as for users with limited access to keyboards and mice.
